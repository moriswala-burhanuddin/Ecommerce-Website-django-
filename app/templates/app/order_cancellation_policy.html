    <p>At Burhani, we understand that sometimes circumstances change, and you may need to cancel an order. To ensure a smooth cancellation process, we encourage you to reach out to our customer support team as soon as possible. You can contact us via email, phone, or through our website chat feature. Our dedicated support staff is available to assist you with your cancellation requests and guide you through the process.</p>
    
    <p>It’s important to remember that cancellations must be made before the order has been shipped. Once an order is in transit, we may not be able to accommodate cancellations due to the logistical challenges involved. If your order has already been shipped, you will need to follow our return policy to send the product back once it arrives.</p>

    <p>We value your time and understand that life can be unpredictable. Therefore, we strive to process cancellations quickly and efficiently. Once your cancellation request is received, you will receive a confirmation email detailing the next steps, and your refund will be processed promptly. Please allow up to 2 hours for the refund to reflect in your account, depending on your bank’s processing times.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions regarding our cancellation policy or need assistance with your order, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we are here to help you in any way we can.</p>
